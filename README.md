# Job-Applications
Apply to 13,000 jobs online with python

I use 4 (resume type) x 4 (race) x 2 (gender) study design, and create an applicant for each account. 
I designate each applicant to apply to 10-12 medium sized cities all around the US. 
I open this script on 32 different computers, change which applicant it will log in to, and run the script.
It ended up applying to 12,600 jobs.
One of the careerbuilder accounts stopped working. I don't think they liked it when I would log into 32 different accounts
and upload a resume all in 30 min.

The cities that each applicant applied to can be found in Destinations.xlsx
The final excel sheet of all the applications can be found in JobApplicationsAll.xlsx
